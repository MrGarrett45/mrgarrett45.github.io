              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                I wanted to create a project that would both get me familiar
                with the latest AI technology coming out and also put the AWS
                Solutions Architect Professional certificate I recently received
                to use. I settled on creating an AI powered financial advisor
                that would make it simple for the user to input their financial
                information and ask questions with the bot being aware of that
                input so it can tailor specific advice. Although this is only a
                side project, I do believe that given only a limited number of
                people have access to a financial advisor democratizing some of
                that access to high quality financial advice can go a long way
                in making solid financial information available to everyone. I
                am certain in the future companies like Mint or your whichever
                bank you use will have these bots built into their services but
                I wanted to see what I could create on my own and as a software
                engineer test out some of the technology that I'm sure will be
                finding it's way into my work sooner or later.

              <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>AI (Open AI's ChatGPT API)</li>
                <li>Angular 2+</li>
                <li>Express.js (with Typescript)</li>
                <li>AWS Serverless (with Terraform for IaC)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                My choice of frontend/backend tech here was fairly simple. I
                wanted to balance what I was comfortable with with what made the
                most technical sense. I've used Angular 2+ professionally for a
                number of years so that was a simple choice. Most of my backend
                development work has been with .NET/C# but I decided to try
                something new with Express for the purpose of keeping the entire
                codebase (besides the Terraform) in Typescript. This allowed for
                quick development, ability to reuse code, and simplified the
                hosting process.
              </p>
              <p>
                Going with AWS was another simple choice because of the
                certificate I mentione receiving above as well as being the
                cloud provider I'm most comfortable with. The decision to go
                with serverless technologies was due to both cost and getting
                the project off the ground as quickly as possible. The most
                difficult decision I faced was whether to go with Lambda for the
                backend or host servers/containers on EC2/ECS. I settled on
                Lambda due to both ease and the fact that I am not anticipating
                there to be a large number of users on this project. I am aware
                that Lambda API's can get expensive with a large number of users
                but I believe for the small number of users I am expecting it
                will be cheaper to use Lambda than host a traditional server. I
                also considered the problem of having to deal with Lambda "cold
                starts" but decided I can live with the potential for queries to
                take longer than I'd like in some scenarios but I still believe
                the pros outweigh the cons. Choosing DynamoDB was primarily
                because I haven't used it before and wanted to get a feel for it
                while also not wanting the hassle of maintaining an RDS
                instance. However, after using DynamoDB for this project I still
                much prefer Postgres to it and would probably go through the
                trouble of setting up RDS for future projects.

              <h2>AI Integration</h2>
              <p>
                The integration of AI is done through Open AI's
                <a
                  href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api"
                  >Chat Completion API</a
                >. The model is sent a "system prompt" that tells it how to act.
                I instruct it with something along the lines of "you are a
                financial advisor and the user is your client, the client has
                provided {x} information use that to calibrate your advice",
                where {x} is the financial information the user has sent
                formatted into a string in plain english. Everytime a new
                message is sent the model must be fed the entire history of the
                chat so it can have "memory" of the previous messages. When a
                user sends a new message the backend will check DynamoDB for
                previous messages and if they exist it will add the new message
                to the top of the list and send the entire thing to the model.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Front-end Development with Angular</h2>
              <p>
                I wanted to stick with one component library for a consistent
                look so I went with
                <a href="https://akveo.github.io/nebular/">Nebular</a>. Normally
                I use material or ngbootstrap but they both lacked a chat
                component so I chose nebular and found it very easy to use. I've
                previously implemented my own chat components (for the Blirb
                project linked on my main page) and know it can be difficult so
                decided to go with something prebuilt. After implementing my own
                auth with that project as well I decided to go with Auth0 for
                this project just to get it off the ground quickly. It's worked
                well thus far and I am glad to offload the managing of passwords
                but I will be keeping an eye on the costs. I do use an auth0
                event to hit my "signup" endpoint on the backend once a user has
                signed up so I can add the user to my own database as well as
                having them in auth0.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Back-end Development with Express.js</h2>
              <p>
                Not a ton to say here, it was very easy to configure Express to
                use Typescript and the basic pattern of the framework makes it
                extremely easy to get something up and running quickly. I did
                have to do some interesting work for converting the financial
                information form into plain english thats suitable for the model
                to read. I employed a technique of checking for each input and
                if it exists forming that into a normal sentence and adding it
                on to a continuously growing list of assets/info. This all gets
                incorporated into the system prompt at the beginning instead of
                being appended to each message to the bot.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>CI/CD</h2>
              <p>
                The code for this project was all hosted in Github (monorepo)
                and gets deployed via CodeBuild. For the frontend CodeBuild
                simply builds the project then updates the S3 bucket it lives in
                with the new files. For the backend CodeBuild will build the
                latest code and update the lambda function that code lives in.
              </p>

              <p>
                Management of infrastructure is all done via Terraform. I used a
                pattern of having a central AWS accounts and set up SSO for
                development/production accounts alongside Terraform Workspaces
                for each. This enabled me to easily scale up different
                environments for testing and keep separation between the
                environments.
              </p>

            <section>
              <h2>Future Development</h2>
              <p>
                For the time being I'm going to step away from this project and
                focus on other things, but depending on if people get interested
                or not I may increase complexity or consider something such as
                hosting my own model I can more finely tune. The fact that it
                was fairly simple for someone like me with no formal AI
                experience to pick up this technology and create a product in a
                relatively short amount of time convinced me of it's power and
                that we will be seeing much more of it all over the place in
                short order. I do believe if a project like mine was to be
                integrated with something like Mint where all your financial
                information already lives it could be extremely powerful.
